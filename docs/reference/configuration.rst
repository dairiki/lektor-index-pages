The Configuration File
======================

This plugin is configured via a configuration file named ``index-pages.ini`` in the |configs directory|_ of the Lektor tree.

.. |configs directory| replace:: ``configs`` subdirectory
.. _configs directory: https://www.getlektor.com/docs/plugins/howto/#configure-plugins


Top-Level Indexes
-----------------

Each section in the config file which has a *non-dotted* section name and which includes a setting for the ``key`` key defines a top-level index.  
The index is named after the section name.

Recognized keys:

``parent_path``

    The lektor path_ of the record under which the index virtual source objects will be created.  
    This defaults to ":samp:`/`".

.. _path: https://www.getlektor.com/docs/content/paths/

``items``

    A jinja-evaluated expression which specifies the query_ used to determine which records are to be indexed.  
    It defaults to :samp:`{parent}.children`, where :samp:`{parent}` is the record specified by the ``parent_path`` key (see above).

.. _query: https://www.getlektor.com/docs/api/db/query/

``key``

    **Required**.
    This key defines the index key(s).
    It is a jinja-evaluated expression which is evaluated in a context with ``item`` set to the record to be indexed.  
    This expression should evaluate either to a single string, or, for multi-valued keys, to a sequence of strings.

``template``

    The names of the the Jinja template used to generate each index page.
    Defaults to ``index-pages.html``.

``slug_format``

    Specifies the URL slug to be used for the index pages in this index.
    This is a jinja-evaluated expression evaulated in a context with ``this`` set to the index page virtual source object.
    The default is ``this.key`` (or, equivalently, ``this._id``).

``subindex``

    To declare a sub-index, this key is set to the name of the sub-index.  
    The sub-index must be configured in its own config section (see :ref:`below <subindex-config>`.)


Fields
------

There may be an additional section in the config file for each index named :samp:`[{index-name}.fields]` which can be used to define fields which will be made available on the index `virtual source object`\s.

Each key in the *fields* config section defines a field of the same name.  
The value of the key is a `jinja-evaluated expression <expression_>`_ which is evaluated with ``this`` set to the index virtual source object.

Please note that the config file is first and foremost parsed by `inifile`_, which strips outer quote marks (but only if they're the same: ``"`` or ``'``), before jinja gets a chance to evaluate the resulting expression.
This is especially important when working with constant values for your fields.

Pagination
----------

Pagination settings applying to all indexes may be placed in the ``[pagination]`` config section.  
Settings particular to a specific index (and its sub-indexes) may be placed in a config section named :samp:`[{index-name}.pagination]`.  
(And so on: sub-index specific pagination settings go in :samp:`[{index-name}.{subindex-name}.pagination]`.)
Settings from all of these sections are merged, with those from more specific sections overriding the settings in the generic sections.

The keys recognized in this section are ``enabled``, ``per_page``, and ``url_suffix``.  
These work the same as the like-named keys for `Lektorâ€™s built-in pagination system <pagination_>`_ and `project file`_, with the exception that the ``items`` key is not supported.

.. _subindex-config:

Sub-Indexes
-----------

Sub-indexes are configured in a section named :samp:`[{index-name}.{subindex-name}]`, where :samp:`{subindex-name}` is the name of the sub-index specified in the ``subindex`` key of the parent indexes config section (:samp:`[{index-name}]`).

The only keys supported in the sub-index config section are ``key``, ``template``, ``slug_format``, and (to declare a sub-sub-index) ``subindex``.
These have the same meanings as they do for a top-level index.


Annotated Example
